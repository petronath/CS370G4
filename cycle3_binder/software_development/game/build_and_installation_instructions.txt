To build our game in an IDE, go to https://github.com/petronath/RacingGamev3.git
There you will find a READ_ME with more details.

To install/execute our game, download RacingGamev3Executable.jar (in the same folder as this text document). Once downloaded, double-clicking it should launch the game.
