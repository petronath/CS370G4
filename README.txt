This branch is for all the code of the current working version of the game. Other branches are for writing new code and 
only pulling that code into the master branch when it works and is approved.

This branch is also a place to provide the cycle deliverables.

GO TO https://github.com/petronath/RacingGamev3.git FOR CLONING THE REPOSITORY (all files for building the game are there).
